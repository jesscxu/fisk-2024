Hi! I'm Remi, a junior studying computer science from Ekiti state, Nigeria.
I have engaged in a number of SWE related programs and internship so far and in those I found my love for solving problems.
In my leisure time, I love to play pickleball with my friends, read a great friction book or develop new food and pastry recipes.
I am super excited to be a TA this semester and to help you learn the fundamentals in computer science :)
