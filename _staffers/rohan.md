Hi, I’m Rohan, and I’m excited to be your TA this semester(Hopefully if I am selected)! I am a junior majoring in Computer Science. Originally from Nepal, I came to the U.S. two years ago to pursue my studies. I have interned at Google and Department of Energy. Additionally, I have been involved with the robotics team at the Fisk AI Club. In my free time, I love playing basketball and biking on the trails around the city.
