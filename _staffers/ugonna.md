Hi! I’m Ugonna, and I’m excited to be one of your TAs this semester! I was born and raised in Abuja, Nigeria, and I am a Computer Science major here at Fisk. I had no knowledge of programming before I started school here, so I know how challenging it may seem for some of you. I am here to assist and support you through this class, so always feel free to reach out to me when in need of help. Outside of work, I enjoy music, playing football and swimming!
