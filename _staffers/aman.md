Hello, I'm Aman, and I'm thrilled to be back at Fisk as a TA this fall! Originally from Nepal, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science here at Fisk. After graduating this past summer, I joined Google in June and have been enjoying my time working in the Pittsburgh office with the Shopping Personalization team. When I'm not working, you can find me watching TV shows, biking, playing video games.
