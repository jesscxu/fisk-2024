Hi! My name is Jessica and I am so excited to be teaching this intro to CS course at Fisk this semester as a part of Google's GIR program :) I was born and raised in Columbus, OH and then moved to California to attend UC Berkeley where I majored in Applied Math and Computer Science. After graduating, I moved to San Francisco where I worked at two different start ups as a software engineer for a few years. After that, I got a job at Google and moved to Seattle to work on Google Cloud's web accessibility team and I have been doing that for >4 years now!
