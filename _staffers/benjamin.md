Hi! My name is Benjamin, and I am thrilled to be a Teaching Assistant for this Intro to Computing I course at Fisk this semester. I am originally from Lagos, Nigeria, and I am currently a computer science sophomore here at Fisk University. Aside from my studies, I love learning languages and enjoy playing video games. I look forward to working with you all and supporting your journey in computer science!
