Hi, I'm Ann Mossman. I'm an Engineering Manager for the Flutter and Dart Developer Experience Team where I help guide software engineers in their careers. I was a TA last year for GIR and enjoyed the experience so much that I came back this year. In my never enough spare time, I train in Tae Kwon Do, watch K-Drama and Anime, spend time with my family, play video and board games, enjoy digital music production and sight reading piano music, drawing, and writing fiction.
