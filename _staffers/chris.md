Hi! I'm Chris, and I'm excited to be one of your Googler TAs this semester! I grew up in Boston, MA, then went to University of Rochester for Math and Computer Science (and TAed a few CS classes while I was there). I moved back to Boston after graduation, and I've been at Google there for 8 years or so now, currently working on Web Platform APIs in the Chromium web browser. Outside of work, I love rock climbing, swimming, and biking!
