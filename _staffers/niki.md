Hello everyone, my name is Niki! I'm from the Bay Area and went to UC Berkeley, where I was on the course staff for The Beauty and Joy of Computing for 6 semesters. I've been working at Google on the Cloud AI Frontend team since graduating 4 years ago. Last fall, I was the GIR instructor at Florida International University. I'm extremely passionate about CS education, so I'm very excited to be TAing CSCI 100 this semester! You can talk to me about anything computer science or software engineering related, or one of my many interests (highlights include crafting, travel, movies, tv, girly pop music, hip hop, and the 49ers).
