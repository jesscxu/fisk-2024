Focused on filling life with activities I enjoy and love doing, having the most fun, and living my best life! I work as a Developer Relations Engineer at Google - creating content like videos, blogs, and code samples as well as presenting at conferences to help developers with Firebase! In the past, I coded a lot more as a software engineer, and Iâ€™m very involved in mentoring, teaching, and speaking to students in historically underrepresented groups in tech; as such, I've taught at Fisk at a GIR twice! You can learn more about my career journey and how I live nomadically without a phone!
