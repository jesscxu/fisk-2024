Focused on filling life with activities I enjoy and love doing, having the most fun, and living my best life! I work as a [Developer Relations Engineer](tinyurl.com/whatsdre) at Google - creating content like videos, blogs, and code samples as well as presenting at conferences to help developers build, manage, and grow apps with [Firebase](firebase.google.com)! In the past, I coded a lot more as a [software engineer](https://medium.com/@careermentor/whats-a-day-to-day-of-a-software-engineer-like-92d30ab79a30), and I'm very involved in mentoring, teaching, and speaking to students in historically underrepresented groups in tech. This semester, I'm stepping away from my work at Google to come teach this class full-time, and I'm really excited to be here! You can learn more about [my career journey](https://medium.com/@andreacareer/my-career-journey-adfd377781e0) and how I [live nomadically](http://tinyurl.com/nomadqa) without a [phone](http://tinyurl.com/myphonestory)!
